# Proposal
## High Concept
It's breakout, but with additional graphics and power-ups

## Genre
An action-puzzle game, where you have to actively solve the puzzle... or die.

## Platform
The game will be designed for desktop, but the intent is to make it "mobile-friendly" if time allows.

## Premise
In this game there is a bouncing ball that you have to redirect at the bricks at the top of the page. The ball will break the bricks, depending on the durability of the bricks and power of the ball. There are also power-ups that appear from certain bricks which can either strenghten or weaken the player. The goal is to break all the bricks to advance to the next level.

## Esthetics
### Graphics Style
The graphics will be a combination of stylized, abstract and cartoonish. I will be testing the different styles and see which fits the environment best. I might even switch between styles depending on difficulty or level.

### Sound
There will be some sound, but a continuous bouncing "boing-boing" sound would get quite annoying.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player would have the option to choose which "drops" they collect, which would give them the associated power-up or -down. There will be some geometry involved to change the angle of the ball associated with the bouncing action. The velocity of the ball will depend on the power-ups/downs and the angle at which the ball was hit.

### Control
Control will be done with the arrow keys on a keyboard and if time allows, swiping left and right on a mobile device.

### Teaching The Game
There will be an instruction screen showing the basic movements, but it is a pretty straight forward concept and the player should have the ability to learn the game without any problems.

### Player Learning
There isn't much learning associated with the game. The only things that the player would have to be mindful of are the power-ups and power-downs. These would be either helpful or detremental based on the state of the gameplay at the time of the drop. The biggest teacher of this game will be experience and practice to understand at which angle you need to hit the ball in order to send it in the direction you want it to go.

## About The Developer
Benjamin Kleynhans is doing his Game Design and Development major. While design is part of the major, it is not something that he wants to do. He is a programmer at heart and is more than happy making someone elses vision a reality.
